# Dashboard Component Architecture

**SimpliFi Dashboard: "Your Token Command Center"**

This document outlines the **optimized** modular component architecture for the SimpliFi Dashboard page, designed to align with our enhanced PDR vision of "democratizing token creation for everyone."

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

The Dashboard follows these core principles from our PDR:

-   **🎨 Accessibility First**: Every component designed for blockchain newcomers
-   **📚 Education-Driven**: Contextual learning integrated throughout
-   **🛡️ Security Through Transparency**: Clear non-custodial messaging
-   **⚡ Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, powerful when needed
-   **🌈 Action-Specific Design**: Color-coded actions (Create=Blue, Manage=Green, Distribute=Orange)
-   **👤 User-Centric Focus**: Dashboard centered on individual user's token ecosystem
-   **✨ Simplified Experience**: Reduced visual clutter with focus on essential functionality

**2.2 High-Level Component Description**

-   **Frontend Web Application:** SPA (Single Page Application) providing the UI. Handles user input, state management, wallet interactions (via `@multiversx/sdk-dapp`), and communication with the SimpliFi Backend API. Provides clear feedback on asynchronous blockchain operations.
-   **SimpliFi Backend API:** Stateless service layer. Constructs unsigned transactions, queries blockchain data (via dedicated nodes/APIs), validates inputs, and manages batching for airdrops.
-   **User's Wallet:** Non-custodial MultiversX wallets. Used for signing all state-changing transactions. SimpliFi never accesses private keys.
-   **MultiversX Blockchain:** The source of truth. SimpliFi interacts with:
    -   **System Smart Contracts:** For ESDT issuance and management (`registerAndSetAllRoles`, `pause`, `ESDTLocalMint`, etc.).
    -   **xExchange Smart Contracts:** For providing liquidity (Router and Pair contracts).
    -   **SimpliFiAirdropSC (Custom):** Audited contract for large-batch airdrops.

**2.3 Technology Stack**

-   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript; Zustand/Redux; `@multiversx/sdk-dapp`; Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript (NestJS/Express.js); `@multiversx/sdk-core`, `@multiversx/sdk-network-providers`; PostgreSQL (optional, for caching/preferences).
-   **Smart Contracts (Custom Airdrop SC only):** Rust, MultiversX Rust Framework.
-   **Infrastructure:** Vercel/Netlify (Frontend); AWS/Google Cloud/Render (Backend); Dedicated MultiversX observer nodes (e.g., via Blast API or self-hosted).

**2.4 MultiversX Integration Details**

-   **ESDT Issuance & Management:** Backend constructs transactions using native system calls (e.g., `registerAndSetAllRoles` for issuance, `ESDTLocalMint`, `pause`, `transferOwnership` for management).
-   **Airdrop:** For small lists (<= ~255 recipients), backend uses `ESDTMultiTransfer`. For larger lists, backend facilitates funding of and calls to `SimpliFiAirdropSC`.
-   **DEX Liquidity (xExchange):** Backend constructs `ESDTTransferAndExecute` or `MultiESDTTransferAndExecute` calls to the xExchange Router for `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityEgld`.
-   **Transaction Signing:** All transactions are signed client-side via `@multiversx/sdk-dapp` and the user's chosen wallet.

**3. Detailed Feature Specifications**

**3.1 ESDT Token Creation (Fungible Tokens Only for V1)**
Guided wizard for issuing new Fungible ESDT tokens.

-   **Workflow:**
    1. **Basic Information:** Token Name, Ticker (real-time availability check, EGLD cost for ticker displayed), Initial Supply, Number of Decimals (default 18, with clear explanation).
    2. **Token Properties:** Plain language explanations, sensible defaults, "Advanced Settings" toggle.
        - **Supply Type:** Fixed (default, `canMint`=false) or Variable (`canMint`=true, issuer gets mint role).
        - **Burnable:** (`canBurn`=true/false, default true). If true, any holder (including owner) can burn their own tokens.
        - **Ownership Transfer:** (`canChangeOwner`=true/false, default true). Allows transfer of management rights.
        - **Advanced (default No/false):** Pausable (`canPause`), Freezable (`canFreeze`), Wipeable (`canWipe`, requires Freezable), Upgradable Properties (`canUpgrade`), NFT Payment Currency (`ESDTRoleNFTCreate`).
    3. **Review & Confirm:** Summary of choices, total EGLD network fee. "Are you sure?" confirmation.
    4. **Transaction Signing:** User signs `registerAndSetAllRoles` transaction.
    5. **Confirmation:** Success message, explorer link, token appears in management dashboard.
-   **Technical:** Backend uses `registerAndSetAllRoles` system call.

**3.2 ESDT Token Management**
Dashboard for owners to manage their created tokens based on initial properties.

-   **Dashboard Overview:** Lists tokens managed by connected wallet, key details.
-   **Core Actions (V1, if properties allow & user is manager):**
    1. **View Detailed Info:** All properties, supplies, owner, explorer links.
    2. **Mint Tokens:** If `canMint`=true and user has `ESDTRoleLocalMint`. Input amount.
    3. **Burn Own Tokens:** If `canBurn`=true. Input amount from own balance.
    4. **Pause/Unpause Token Operations:** If `canPause`=true. Toggle.
    5. **Transfer Token Management Rights:** If `canChangeOwner`=true. Input new manager address. Critical warnings.
-   **Advanced Actions (Consider for V1.x or "Advanced Zone"):** Freeze/Unfreeze, Wipe, Modify Properties (if `canUpgrade`=true), Delegate Special Roles.
-   **Technical:** Backend constructs relevant system calls (`ESDTLocalMint`, `ESDTLocalBurn`, `pause`, `transferOwnership`, etc.).

**3.3 Airdrop Tool**
Distributes ESDTs to multiple recipients, choosing strategy based on list size.

-   **Common Workflow:**
    1. **Select Token.**
    2. **Prepare Recipient List:** CSV upload or manual input. Address/amount validation.
    3. **Review & Strategy:** Platform calculates totals. If list <= `MAX_DIRECT_RECIPIENTS` (e.g., 255), uses "Direct Airdrop." Else, "Campaign Airdrop (via SC)."
-   **Direct Airdrop (`ESDTMultiTransfer`):**
    -   For smaller lists. Backend prepares one `ESDTMultiTransfer` transaction from user's account. User signs.
-   **Campaign Airdrop (`SimpliFiAirdropSC`):**
    -   For larger lists. Dedicated, audited SC.
    -   Functions: `distributeTokens(tokenId, recipients, amounts)`, `reclaimOverfundedTokens(...)`.
    -   Process: User transfers total airdrop amount to `SimpliFiAirdropSC`. Then, user signs 1+ transactions (batched by backend) calling `distributeTokens`.
-   **Completion:** Summary, reports/explorer links.

**3.4 DEX Liquidity Provision (Initial Liquidity on xExchange)**
Wizard to guide users in adding initial liquidity, making their token tradable. Strong emphasis on education and risk warnings.

-   **Workflow:**
    1. **Introduction & Education:** Explains liquidity pools, LP tokens, key risks (initial pricing, impermanent loss). Disclaimer.
    2. **Select Your Token (Token A).**
    3. **Choose Pairing Token (Token B):** E.g., EGLD, USDC. Display user balances.
    4. **Define Initial Liquidity & Price:** User inputs amounts for Token A and Token B. Platform calculates and displays resulting initial price. Critical warnings about price setting.
    5. **Review & Confirm Risks:** Summary of deposit, price, LP tokens. Explicit "I understand the risks" checkbox.
    6. **Transaction Execution:** User signs `addLiquidity` or `addLiquidityEgld` transaction (via `ESDTTransferAndExecute` to xExchange Router).
    7. **Confirmation:** Success message, LP tokens received, link to xExchange pool. Reminder: manage LP position on xExchange.
-   **Technical:** Backend integration with xExchange Router contracts. Consider `@multiversx/sdk-exchange`.

**3.5 User Authentication & Wallet Integration**
Non-custodial wallet integration using `@multiversx/sdk-dapp`.

-   **Supported Wallets:** xPortal App (Mobile via WalletConnect), MultiversX DeFi Wallet (Browser Extension), Ledger, Web Wallet.
-   **Flow:** "Connect Wallet" -> Modal with options -> User selects & approves -> Address/balances displayed.
-   **Transaction Signing:** All transactions proposed by SimpliFi, signed by user in their wallet. SimpliFi never sees private keys.
-   **Session Management:** Optional persistence, clear disconnect.
